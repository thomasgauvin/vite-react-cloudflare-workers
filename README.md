# React + Vite + Cloudflare Workers

A tiny template for ⚡️ vite ⨉ ⚛️ react ⨉ 🌊 tailwindcss ⨉ ⛅️ cloudflare workers.

Basically [partyvite](https://github.com/threepointone/partyvite) but without the party(kit). Also basically the tutorial in the [`@cloudflare/vite-plugin` repo](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/vite-plugin-cloudflare#tutorial).

## Get started

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- --template thomasgauvin/vite-react-cloudflare-workers
```

Don't forget to rename your app/package in `package.json`, `wrangler.json`.
